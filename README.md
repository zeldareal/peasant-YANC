yet another weird nvim, but without nixvim...


# installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeldareal/peasant-YANC.git
cd peasant-YANC
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
!! always check install scripts you find literally anywhere !!

## first launch

open nvim with 'nvim'
wait for lazy.nvim to install plugins (expect errors, they're normal)
run ':Mason' to verify LSP servers
restart nvim

## more info?

head over to the main repo, it has all the info : https://github.com/zeldareal/YAWN
